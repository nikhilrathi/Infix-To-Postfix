Infix to Postfix:

This is a program where an Infix expression is converted to a Postfix Expression

For this program I have used my own implementation of the Stack class named MyStack

In the Problem.java file you can check the conversion of infix expression to postfix

Also I have included a method to evaluate the postfix expression.
